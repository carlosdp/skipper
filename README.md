=Skipper
Skipper is a simple Chrome extension that adds a small "skip" link to directories on GitHub that allow you to skip through verbose, single-branch structures (such as Java's).

It works with any version of GitHub (including FI) and is entirely non-invasive. Save yourself from tedious clicks today!

==Install
The extension is available for download on the Chrome Web Store [Here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/skipper/nfmomefhbogooebpmdhpgpnnbpjlgnje?hl=en&gl=US).
